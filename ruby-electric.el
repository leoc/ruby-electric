;; ruby-electric.el --- electric editing commands for unique ruby syntax
;;
;; Destroying all character closing commands, as the semantics in ruby-electric are done
;; far less comprehensively than are done in autopair.el (http://autopair.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/autopair.el)
;; Improved the semantic comprehension of pipes and blocks, so that the closing pipe or end is only inserted
;; if an appropriately matching end is not already present.

heuristicaly inserted whenever typing a word like 'module',

'do'. Simple, double and back quotes as well as braces are paired
auto-magically. Expansion does not occur inside comments and
